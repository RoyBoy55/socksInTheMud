    <h1>Socks in the mud</h1>

    <p>In the dark ages their was a man named Luthor who was a raving mad man. He pilaged and took as he pleased, he was quite the nasty fellow, but his problems started when he was just a boy. When Luthor was young he would run and play all day but the other chideren would avoid him, because his socks where dirty and all the chideren knew the dirty sock where a death wish.</p>
